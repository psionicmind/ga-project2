# App Description
Whale Catcher will scan a selected token(to be select by user) on when any holders of this token send the token to crypto exchange (mainly to sell)

# Tech Stack
React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Api (etherscan.io / coingecko.com / airtable)

# How To Use
The contract address are currently populated with two major meme token, namely Pepe and Shiba inu token, in the Ethereum space.  The wallet address of these two tokens are preloaded with all the exchanges that can buy and sell that specific token.  User need to select the token to be monitored and press the "Catch Whale" button on the WhaleCatcher tab.  

# Output
There are several ways we can monetize.  
1) Upon immediate discovery of any token holder transfer their token to any of the listed exchanges, user can choose to manually short that specific token in crypto futures market.
2) Alternatively, if we hold any of the selected token monitored and there is a trigger, we could sell it first to avoid a dip in value.

# Planned future enhancements (icebox items)
- beautify the user interface
- to build api access to binance/okx/deribit for trade

# Challenges
1) react's setState non-immediate assignment of value
2) address have to be regularly updated (weekly)
3) CORS restriction
